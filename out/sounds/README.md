# Sound Files for Jeopardy LM

This directory contains sound effects for the Jeopardy LM game:

1. `jeopardy-theme.mp3` - The classic Jeopardy theme song played during question selection (ONLY this file is currently used)

## Current Implementation

The game has been streamlined to only use the Jeopardy theme song. Other sound effects have been removed for simplicity and better user experience.

## Note

You need to add an actual jeopardy-theme.mp3 file to this directory for sound to work properly. For legal reasons, we cannot include the actual Jeopardy theme music in this repository. You can find royalty-free alternatives or use the official Jeopardy theme if you have the proper license.

For educational or personal use, search for "royalty-free game show music" or create a placeholder sound file.
